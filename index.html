              Hey there, thanks for checking out my website! My name is Rahal
              and I'm a soon to be full stack web developer based in Melbourne,
              Australia. <br /><br />
              I've previously worked as a service desk engineer in my past roles
              and have worked very closely with businesses and customers the
              like to build the key IT skills that I possess today. I greatly
              enjoy tinkering and working on my own small projects such as my
              own personal home server.
              <br /><br />
              If I'm not at my desk working on my web development skills or any
              other side projects, you'll likely catch me out playing badminton
              or hanging out with my dog at the park.

            <h4 class="section-heading">A Quick History Lesson</h4>
            <p class="section-content">
              After working in the hospitality industry for a few years, I
              decided to get my foot into the IT industry by working as a
              service desk engineer. Here, I was able to gain great experience
              working with customers and clients, helping solve any technical
              issues that they would face and provide them with solutions to get
              them back up and running. I would also regularly head on-site to
              help provision devices, work on networks and provide in-person
              support where necessary.
              <br /><br />
              Although I did enjoy this work, I've always been a creative person
              and I've enjoyed working on media projects and creating things
              with my own hands. And so, I decided to make the move to web
              development by joining Coder Academy so I could design and create
              websites and fulfill this creative desire.

                I am and always have been passionate for all things IT which has
                driven me to go outside of my comfort zone and learn all sorts
                of things. This has also taught me patience when working on
                different projects and tasks as it can be hard to grasp new
                concepts and to be able to apply them in the real world.

                Sometimes you have to be able to think outside of the box and
                I've found this definitely applies to web development too. I've
                worked on projects for clients in my previous roles which hasn't
                always worked out as expected but with time, I've always been
                able to get the task completed.
